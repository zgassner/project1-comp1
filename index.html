		<p>Some nights I sleep with my dress on. My teeth are small and even. I don’t get headaches. Since 1971 or before, I have hunted a bench where I could eat my pimento cheese in peace. If this were Tennessee and across that river, Arkansas, I’d meet you in West Memphis tonight. We could have a big time. Danger, shoulder soft. Do not lie or lean on me. I’m still trying to find a job for which a simple machine isn’t better suited. I’ve seen people die of money. Look at Admiral Benbow. I wish like certain fishes, we came equipped with light organs. Which reminds me of a little known fact:if we were going the speed of light, this dome would be shrinking while we were gaining weight. Isn’t the road crooked and steep. In this humidity, I make repairs by night. I’m not one among millions who saw Monroe’s face in the moon. I go blank looking at that face. If I could afford it I’d live in hotels. I won awards in spelling and the Australian crawl. Long long ago. Grandmother married a man named Ivan. The men called him Eve. Stranger, to tell the truth, in dog years I am up there.</p>
