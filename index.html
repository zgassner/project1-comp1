		<p>&nbsp;Some nights I sleep with my dress on. <br> &nbsp;My teeth are small and even. <br> I don’t get headaches. <br> Since 1971 or before, I have hunted a bench where I could eat my pimento cheese in peace. <br> If this were Tennessee and across that river, Arkansas, I’d meet you in West Memphis tonight. <br> We could have a big time. <br> Danger, shoulder soft. <br> Do not lie or lean on me. <br> I’m still trying to find a job for which a simple machine isn’t better suited. <br> I’ve seen people die of money. <br> Look at Admiral Benbow. <br> I wish like certain fishes, we came equipped with light organs. <br> Which reminds me of a little known fact: if we were going the speed of light, this dome would be shrinking while we were gaining weight. <br> Isn’t the road crooked and steep. <br> In this humidity, I make repairs by night. <br> I’m not one among millions who saw Monroe’s face in the moon. <br> I go blank looking at that face. <br> If I could afford it I’d live in hotels. <br> I won awards in spelling and the Australian crawl. <br> Long long ago. Grandmother married a man named Ivan. <br> The men called him Eve. <br> Stranger, to tell the truth, in dog years I am up there.</p>
